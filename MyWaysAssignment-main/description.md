## Backend Part

I completed most of the backend as I am good in backend. I used SendGrid API for the Email OTP which is paid we have free option like GMAIL but It takes time to setup everything. Also a key value DB for OTP can be implemented to store the OTP again it takes time to implement things right now I used simple global objects to store the OTP.

## Frontend Part

I have very less time left for the frontend and there are many things to do and Due to less time I have not implemented the entire design and there are some design issues. Mobile design is not provided so I only made it for desktops (the time is limited).
